SQL queries and dat source files in the DATA folder

Locate queries in file: ..\DATA\employee_SQL_homework_final.sql

Prior to exporting from QuickDBD, my table creation is in the working file.
     ..\DATA\employee_SQL_homework_working.sql
Queries ran properly but did not have key set up at that time.

QuickDBD-export.sql  contains the create table and alter table code adding
key information
