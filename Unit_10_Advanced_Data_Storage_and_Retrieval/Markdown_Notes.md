Donald Stegman  SMU Data Science


    This assignment required the use of an ORM, specifically Sql Alchemy. The notation is more pythonic than executing Sql queries. The dot notation becomes easy to use and recognize the more one uses it. Part one of the assignment is located in the file climate_working.ipynb. the visualizations are created through the use of this Jupyter Notebook: Fig1.png, Fig2.png, and Fig3.png.
    Part 2 of the assignment is contained in the python file app.py; this utilizes the Flask ORM. It creates a basic website that contains various pages that run Sql queries that return weather information.
    Tobs is temperature observations. Precipitation returns rainfall amount. Additional paths are specified on the home page running from the internal server location: http://127.0.0.1:5000
    

Please enjoy!
